# PufferchickTrophy-CP
A Pufferchick mod for his birthday, for Stardew Valley

In the event that I have not been active on the chucklefish forums, Nexus Mods, or SDV public discord for at least 30 days, I give permission for any willing SDV modder to fork, modify and distribute code from this repository.

In the event a new SDV and/or SMAPI version is released that breaks compatibility of my mods, the inactivity duration only needs to be 7 days for the above permission to be valid.

I ask that should I return after such a time, that the person who was kind enough to take over maintenance of my mods return them to myself.
